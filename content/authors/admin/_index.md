Clayton "Dan" McManus is a professional in the carnival fundraising industry. Alongside his Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Economics, he has been helping non-profit organizations, churches, local residents, and businesses owners to raise money for many years. After getting better acquainted in the field, Dan decided to take on his new title as business owner and opened his own company, McManus Amusements in 2018. Originally, he planned to service the New Jersey/New York area, but has more recently expanded his services to the Maryland and Pennsylvania areas as the business has grown exponentially in just the first two years. 

Dan lives by his honesty and integrity, and understands the best way to raise funds is to be completely transparent and affordable with his customers. With ample experience in customer service, Dan ensures that his events will be the easiest, simplest way to increase your revenue, all while having fun in the process!
